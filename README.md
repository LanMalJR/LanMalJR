## 🚀 Featured projects

> Replace the `🔗 Repo:` lines with actual repository links once you are ready.

### 🚜 Tractor Driving VR Simulator (Masters research artifact)

A VR based tractor driving simulator built in Unity for agricultural training and safety.  
It focused on realistic tractor operation, user familiarisation and evaluation of training outcomes.

- **Tech:** Unity, C#, XR Interaction Toolkit, basic physics and interaction systems  
- **Highlights:** Custom vehicle controller, seat locking system, gear shifting, indicators, headlights, in cabin UI, farm environment

🔗 Repo: `<!-- TODO: add Tractor VR repository link here -->`

### 👁️ Eye Tracking Interaction Project

An HCI oriented project that used eye tracking data to study how users interacted with interfaces.  
The goal was to understand attention, usability and interaction patterns.

- **Tech:** Eye tracking hardware and software, data analysis (SAS / Python), reporting  
- **Highlights:** Experiment design, data capture, basic analytics and visualisation

🔗 Repo: `<!-- TODO: add eye tracking project repository or report link here -->`

### 💸 Mazzel – AI assisted money coach web app

A web application concept that helped users track income and expenses, and receive AI generated recommendations on saving and investing.  
The system aimed to support realistic goal planning, for example saving for a child’s education or building generational wealth.  
All recommendations were framed as guidance, not financial advice.

- **Tech:** Web stack (frontend and backend), basic Docker, AI integration concept  
- **Highlights:** Budget capture flows, goal simulation idea, non binding recommendation engine design

🔗 Repo: `<!-- TODO: add Mazzel repository link here -->`
